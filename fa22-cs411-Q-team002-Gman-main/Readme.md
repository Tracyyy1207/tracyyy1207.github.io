## Open-Flight Database

This is a relational (SQL) database-centric web-based application project.
There are a lot of passengers searching for an appropriate flight every day, hour, and even every second. Therefore, it is necessary to have a search engine that is capable of many functions with different features, such as checking airline status, finding the nearest routes even under emergency situations, and making travel plans for users based on their preferences ahead of time. This is exactly what our project does.
