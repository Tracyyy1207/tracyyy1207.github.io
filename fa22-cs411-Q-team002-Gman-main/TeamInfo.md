## Project Summary

There are a lot of passengers searching for an appropriate flight every day, every hour, and even every second. Therefore, it is necessary to have a search engine to help each person around the world find their flights, which is exactly what our project Open_Flight_Database does. Open_Flight_Database is basically an integrated database system as well as a searching engine, which is capable of many functions with different features, such as checking airline statuses and finding the most nearest routes even under emergency situations, making travel plans for users based on their preferences ahead of time, and finding the lowest ticket price. Our main dataset is collected from the openflight website, and we will construct many relational data models with SQL operations to generate the whole system during the process.
